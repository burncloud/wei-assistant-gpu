      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema design task into subtasks covering: 1) Research and define appropriate SQLite data types for each field, 2) Create the formal schema definition with constraints and comments, 3) Document relationships and integrity rules, 4) Create a visual representation of the schema",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing a database schema with 16 specified fields, requiring knowledge of SQLite data types, constraints, and proper documentation. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful consideration of data types and constraints, but is focused on a single table."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database initialization module implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Database existence checking logic, 2) Database creation functionality, 3) Table creation with proper schema implementation, 4) Error handling and idempotence verification",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a module that initializes the database if it doesn't exist. The complexity is moderate-low as it requires implementing database creation logic, applying the schema, and ensuring idempotence, but uses standard SQLite functionality."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the command-line argument parser implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Research and select appropriate argument parsing library, 2) Define argument syntax for JSON input mode, 3) Define argument syntax for parameter-based input mode, 4) Implement input type detection logic, 5) Create comprehensive help text and documentation",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a dual-mode argument parser that can handle both JSON and parameter-based inputs. The complexity is moderate-high due to the need to support two different input formats, detect the format automatically, and provide clear documentation."

      "reasoning": "This task involves creating functionality to validate and insert data into the database. The complexity is high due to the need to validate 16 different fields, handle two input formats, implement secure parameterized queries, and provide appropriate error handling."

      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing basic query functionality to retrieve all records. The complexity is relatively low as it involves a simple SELECT query without filtering, though proper error handling and result structuring add some complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task involves extending the query functionality to support filtering by any field with various comparison operators. The complexity is high due to the need to create a flexible query builder that can handle different field types and operators while maintaining security with parameterized queries."

      "reasoning": "This task involves creating functionality to format query results in multiple formats. The complexity is moderate-high due to the need to handle proper alignment in tabular output, consider terminal width constraints, and ensure consistent representation across formats."

      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating all modules into a cohesive command-line tool. The complexity is high due to the need to handle different commands, route arguments correctly, manage dependencies between modules, and provide comprehensive error handling and user feedback."
